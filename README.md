## ✨ Description

**RickAndMortyApp** is a native iOS application built in Swift using **UIKit**, **URLSession**, and **MVVM** architecture. It fetches character data from the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) and displays it in a modern, scrollable **CollectionView** interface.

The app is structured for scalability and maintainability using clean separation of concerns and programmatic layout.

## 🛠 Technologies

- 🧠 **MVVM architecture** for modular design
- 🧱 **UIKit** with programmatic **Auto Layout**
- 🔁 **UICollectionView** for grid-based character display
- 🌐 **URLSession** for network communication
- 📦 Native Swift — no third-party libraries
- 🧪 Tested on **iPhone 16 (iOS 18.2)**

---

## 🚀 Setup

1. Clone the project and open it in **Xcode 15 or later**.
2. The app fetches data from the public Rick and Morty API — no API key required.
3. Run on an **iOS 18.2 simulator or device** with internet access.

## 🧩 Features

- 👽 Browse all Rick and Morty characters in a collection grid.
- 🔍 Tap on a character to view detailed information (optional depending on implementation).
- ⚙️ Fully implemented with **MVVM** and native networking via **URLSession**.
- 💎 Smooth performance using **UICollectionView**.

---

## ▶️ Running

- Build and run with `Cmd + R` in Xcode.
- Ensure internet connection to load character data.

---

## 🧪 Testing

- Architecture allows for easy unit testing of services and view models.
- You can run tests using `Cmd + U` in Xcode.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Data source: [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)
